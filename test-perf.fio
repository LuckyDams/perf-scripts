# Performance testing jobs
# (basic sequential/random read/write tests)
#
# Usage:
#   fio test-perf.fio --directory=/path/to/destination [--section=NAME] \
#       [--runtime=30s] [--numjobs=1] [--size=8g] [--eta-newline=5s]
#
#   section:        Job name to run, otherwise all jobs are run sequentially.
#   runtime:        Run job for specified period of time, if omitted will stop at end of file.
#   numjobs:        Number  of  clones  (processes/threads  performing  the same workload) of this job.
#   size:           Only required when test file does not exist in destination.
#   eta-newline:    Display ETA on new line every time interval (optional).
#
# Note: IO size an depth values for sequential & random jobs can be adapted to your needs
# in this file. Default values are suitable for most throughput/bandwidth based testing.
